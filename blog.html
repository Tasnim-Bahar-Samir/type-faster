                <h1>What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
                <p>
                    SessionStorage and localStorage is almost similar. The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire untill we clear the data manually. But data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.

                <h2>What is the difference between Global scope Block scope.</h2>
                <p>
                    The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.  On the other side, 
                    <br>
                    The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. We are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets.

                    What is event loop in Javascript?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed.

                <h2>When we will get undefind in javascript?</h2>
                <p>We can get undefind for many reasons.
                    Like, A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.
